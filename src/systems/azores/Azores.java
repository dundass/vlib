// brief - Essentially what we'd like is a DVD of around 45-minutes of projections. Our musical style is a blend of afrobeat, psychedelic, Eno and Talking Heads-style vibes, 
//		   so I guess we'd be looking for something abstract, colourful, maybe patterns-based, nothing too dark but then nothing too whacky either, if that makes sense?
